# Hello World!
In this project I've demonstrated how to easily create an echo bot with the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). The Bot sends a welcome messsage to the new member added then echos what you say to it.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.

2. In the project directory, install all dependencies.
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. Run the Project.
```bash
mvn clean compile exec:java
```
 ##### Alternatively, run it from your IDE.


4. Install and run the Microsoft BotFramework Emulator. [Download Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-debug-emulator?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp)

5. Open bot on url http://localhost:8080/api/messages
